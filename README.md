*A personal website for me, by me (which will be coded... eventually). This site utilizes a modified version of the [Charadex Framework](charadex.com) by [Cheeriko](https://github.com/cheeriko) for the blog segments.*

Welcome to my website, or my little nook on the Internet. I have some planners and personal details on here, so if you want to look at that I don't really mind. I also have a personal portfolio to look at if anyone is interested in contacting me for non-art work reasons.
